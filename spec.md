# Project Specification

## 1. Background & Problem
**What's the problem?** Submitting tickets for PKR takes too much time since tickets must be created on one board for developers and then added again to another board for PKR submission.

**Who has this problem?** All product managers

**Current situation:** Right now, when product managers prepare tickets for developers, the tickets are created in one board (e.g., the development board). However, for PKR submission, those same tickets need to be manually added or recreated in a different board. This leads to duplicated effort, slows down the submission process, and increases the chance of missing or inconsistent information between boards.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics
**Primary Goal:** To streamline the PKR submission process by reducing manual duplication of tickets across different boards.

**Success looks like:**
- Reduce the average time spent on PKR ticket submission by at least 50%.
- Ensure all PKR-related tickets are automatically or easily synced between the development and PKR boards.
- Eliminate manual duplication errors or missing information between boards.

## 3. Project Overview
**Project Name:** PKR Ticket Submission Automation

**Description:** This project aims to simplify and speed up the PKR submission process by allowing tickets created for developers to be automatically linked, duplicated, or synced to the PKR board. This removes the need for manual re-entry and ensures consistency across boards.

**Target Users:** Product Managers who prepare and submit tickets for PKR.

## 4. What It Should Do
### Core Features
- Auto-sync tickets: When a ticket is created on the development board, it should automatically appear (or be linked) on the PKR board.
- One-click submission: Product managers can easily mark or send a ticket for PKR submission with a single action (e.g., a button or status change).
- Status tracking: Both boards should stay updated with the same ticket status, comments, and attachments to avoid inconsistencies.
- Error prevention: The system should prevent duplicate PKR entries or missing required fields during submission.

### User Actions
- User can create a ticket on the development board as usual.
- User can select or mark the ticket for PKR submission.
- When the user submits or marks the ticket, the system should automatically create or link the same ticket in the PKR board with all necessary information synced.
- When updates are made (e.g., status change or comment added), both boards should reflect the change in real time.

## 5. How It Should Look
**Visual Style:** [e.g., modern, minimal, colorful, professional]

**Colors:** [preferred color scheme if any]

**Layout:** [describe page structure - e.g., "navbar at top, form in center"]

### Key Pages/Sections
- **Page/Section 1:** [What's on this page/section]
- **Page/Section 2:** [What's on this page/section]

## 6. Technical Requirements
**Platform:** A responsive web application that allows users to configure and manage the ticket synchronization rules. This will ensure it works seamlessly on both computers and mobile phones.

**Backend:** The core logic will be handled by a serverless backend (compatible with Vercel or Netlify deployment). This backend will process webhooks from the source board and use APIs to create/update tickets on the destination board.

**Deployment:** The web application and serverless functions will be deployed on Vercel. Vercel is recommended for its seamless Git integration, automatic deployments, and built-in support for serverless functions, which are ideal for this project's architecture.

**Data Storage:** Yes, data needs to be saved.
- **Configuration Data:** The system will store settings for connecting the two boards, such as board IDs and API credentials (encrypted for security).
- **Ticket Mapping Data:** It will save a record of linked tickets (e.g., mapping the ID from the development board to the new ID on the PKR board) to sync updates correctly and prevent duplicates.
- A serverless database (e.g., Vercel Postgres or FaunaDB) will be used for this purpose.

**Integrations:**
- The system will need to integrate with the APIs of the project management tools being used (e.g., Jira, Trello, Asana).
- It will rely on webhooks from the source board to receive real-time notifications about new tickets and updates.

**Note:** The AI will select the most appropriate technologies (like Next.js for the frontend and backend, and a serverless database) to build a robust and scalable solution based on these requirements.

## 7. Example Scenarios
**Scenario 1: Submitting a Ticket for PKR**
- A PM creates a ticket on the development board as usual.
- To submit it for PKR, they either add a specific label (e.g., `pkr-ready`) or move the ticket to a designated "Submit to PKR" column.
- The system automatically detects this action.
- It then creates a copy of the ticket on the PKR board, including the title, description, and attachments.
- The system adds a comment to the original ticket with a link to the newly created PKR ticket (e.g., "Synced to PKR Board as ticket #PKR-123").

## 8. Content & Copy
**Key Headlines:**
- **Main headline:** Automate Your PKR Workflow
- **Subheadline:** Stop manually duplicating tickets. Connect your boards in minutes and let automation handle the rest.

**Call-to-Action Buttons:**
- **Primary CTA text:** Connect Your Boards
- **Secondary CTA text:** View Documentation

**Other Important Text:**
- **Configuration Instructions:** "Choose your source board (where tickets are created) and the destination board (where they will be synced for PKR)."
- **Success Message:** "Connection successful! Your boards are now synced."
